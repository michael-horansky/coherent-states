Initialising molecule...
| Building molecule...
| | There are 10 atomic orbitals, each able to hold 2 electrons of opposing spin.
| | The molecule is occupied by 15 electrons in total: 8 with spin alpha, 7 with spin beta.
| | The molecule consists of the following atoms: ['N', 'O']
| | The atomic orbitals are ordered as follows: ['0 N 1s    ', '0 N 2s    ', '0 N 2px   ', '0 N 2py   ', '0 N 2pz   ', '1 O 1s    ', '1 O 2s    ', '1 O 2px   ', '1 O 2py   ', '1 O 2pz   ']
| | The nuclear repulsion energy is 25.74624321871447

| Reference state analysis
| | Occupied orbitals:
| |   -in the spin-alpha subspace: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
| |   -in the spin-beta subspace:  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
| | Testing each CS type Hamiltonian overlap evaluation against the reference state...
| |   -For Thouless: E_ref = -127.53047, which agrees with the true value
| |   -For Qubit: E_ref = -127.53047, which agrees with the true value
