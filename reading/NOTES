1 reproduce Frank's paper
2 use the generalized SU(M) voherent states to reproduce James's paper (theory and comp)
3 read the 16page paper on general theory of coherent states
4 think about how to apply it to zombie states so that they have fermionic behaviour that conserves particle number

5 jcp paper by ryan on spin-boson model

6 go to the seminar pls atmospheric and theoretical chemistry ALSO quantum chemistry seminar
