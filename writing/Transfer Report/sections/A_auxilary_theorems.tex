\chapter{Auxilary theorems}
This appendix presents mathematical results which were used to derive the mathematical properties of bosonic and fermionic coherent states, but which were chosen to be omitted from the main body of text due to their abstract mathematical nature.

The author does not claim originality of these theorems or their proofs, but chooses to include them, as he was unable to find them in existing literature. The work presented in this appendix is the author's, except for mathematical identities which are stated explicitly.
