Problem: Energy evaluation is wrong

Possible hang-ups:
    -conversion of electron integrals to second quantisation
    -incorrect application of second quantisation operators to occupation basis
    -incorrect transformation from CS to occupation basis (VERY improbable)
    -ommission of constant/not purely electronic Hamiltonian terms (we DO consider the nuclear term though)
    -incorrect H.S. doubling to consider both spin configurations

Checklist
    -Firstly, let's code up a procedure which uses the electron integrals DIRECTLY to find expectation energies of occupation states
        -This should agree with the second quantisation approach!
        -This should be tested on the NULL STATE
    -Also, let's check if H_spin up + H_spin down = H_full



WE'RE MISSING MIXED-SPIN TWO-ELECTRON INTEGRALS! no wait--aren't those integrals trivially zero?
