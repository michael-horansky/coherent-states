Initialising molecule...
| There are 10 atomic orbitals, each able to hold 2 electrons of opposing spin.
| The molecule is occupied by 6 electrons in total: 3 with spin alpha, 3 with spin beta.
| The molecule consists of the following atoms: ['Li', 'Li']
| The atomic orbitals are ordered as follows: ['0 Li 1s    ', '0 Li 2s    ', '0 Li 2px   ', '0 Li 2py   ', '0 Li 2pz   ', '1 Li 1s    ', '1 Li 2s    ', '1 Li 2px   ', '1 Li 2py   ', '1 Li 2pz   ']
| The nuclear repulsion energy is 1.8000000000000003
