| Building molecule...
| | There are 10 atomic orbitals, each able to hold 2 electrons of opposing spin.
| | The molecule is occupied by 15 electrons in total: 8 with spin alpha, 7 with spin beta.
| | The molecule consists of the following atoms: ['N', 'O']
| | The atomic orbitals are ordered as follows: ['0 N 1s    ', '0 N 2s    ', '0 N 2px   ', '0 N 2py   ', '0 N 2pz   ', '1 O 1s    ', '1 O 2s    ', '1 O 2px   ', '1 O 2py   ', '1 O 2pz   ']
